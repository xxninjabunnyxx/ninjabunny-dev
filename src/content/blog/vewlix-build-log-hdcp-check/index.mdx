One of the things I wanted to do with these cabinets is to be able to put anything I want into them, so when I opened up the back I saw the monitor only had a DVI and VGA connector which had me a little bit worried. DVI and HDMI both use the same TDMS signals to carry their video and audio but since this didn’t have an HDMI port I was worried that it didn’t support HDCP meaning that none of my modern systems would run on it without any kind of modification to the video chain.

hooking up the PS4 was relatively simple; it just involved me splitting the audio out of the HDMI and sending it to a separate audio amplifier and getting an HDMI to DVI adapter.

The real test is when I ran an HDCP enabled application on the cabinets and I was pleasantly surprised that it worked flawlessly.
