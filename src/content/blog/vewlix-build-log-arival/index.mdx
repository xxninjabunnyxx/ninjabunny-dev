import { getImage, GatsbyImage } from "gatsby-plugin-image"

<GatsbyImage alt="The Vewlix Cabs" image={getImage(props.localImages[0])} />

A few months ago I paid 2.5 K shiped for knock Vewlixs from China. I knew going into this there were going to be some issues with how the cabinets were made but I’m approaching this like a project instead of buying a finished product.

<GatsbyImage alt="Shipping damage" image={getImage(props.localImages[1])} />

One of the first things I noticed was the shipping damage on one of the cabinets. One of the corners has a big dent in it that affects the internal shelf. I had to pop back into place using an auto body hammer.

<GatsbyImage alt="Rocker switch" image={getImage(props.localImages[2])} />

Another things that I noticed was this rocker switch on the top I found out that is it was to turn on and off the power for the entire cabinet, I will be removing it in the future because I think that it looks dumb.

<GatsbyImage alt="Panel" image={getImage(props.localImages[3])} />

The panel's art isn’t properly aligned and it seems zoomed in. It also has a section with art that “lights up“ but in reality this light is uneven and it just seems like they stuck a bunch of LEDs behind paper. I wanna replace the back part of this panel as well so I can make a more modular interface for add-ons in the future.

I was told by the manufacturer that the buttons and levers are “authentic sanwa parts“ ; this is clearly not the case but I expected as much. The parts feel very cheap and they don’t remotely feel like real Sanwa Parts.

<GatsbyImage alt="Pandora’s box" image={getImage(props.localImages[4])} />

The cabinets came with a thing called a Pandora’s box. It is a board with a bunch of roms of arcade and console games. None of these games run particularly well and almost all of them have an incorrect aspect resolution that you cannot change. These boards are going in the trash

When all is said and done I am very happy with my purchase, like I said earlier I’m treating this like a project, not as a finished product.
